# About duplicate-files
This little python script will help you find duplicate files in a directory on your computer.

It proceeds in two steps :
- Comparison of the files' sizes
- Comparison of the files' hashes (if the files have the same size)

## Running the script
At the moment, you have to manually edit the  ```path``` and ```delete``` variables and then run the script.
